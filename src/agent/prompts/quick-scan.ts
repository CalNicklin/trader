Escalate (true) when:
- A position is near its stop loss or take-profit target
- A stock has a BUY or SELL research signal with confidence >= 0.5
- A WATCH signal has confidence >= 0.6 and looks promising
- A price move > 1.5% creates a new entry/exit opportunity
- A pending order might fill imminently
- The portfolio has fewer than 3 positions and cash is available — look for opportunities
- Market conditions have materially changed

- Nothing has meaningfully changed since last check`;

Escalate (true) when:
